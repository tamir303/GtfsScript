Sure, here's a README for your GTFS data processing and database insertion script:

# GTFS Data Processing and Database Insertion

This script processes GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data and inserts it into a PostgreSQL database.

## Description

The script reads GTFS data from CSV files, processes it, and inserts it into a PostgreSQL database. It creates two tables:
- `line_stops`: Contains bus line stops information.
- `stop_details`: Contains details of bus stops.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL installed and running
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Create a PostgreSQL database and configure connection details in `config/config.yaml`.

4. Place your GTFS data CSV files (`routes.txt`, `stops.txt`, `stop_times.txt`, `trips.txt`) in the `public/` directory.

## Usage

Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python main.py --config /path/to/config.yaml
```

Replace `/path/to/config.yaml` with the path to your configuration file.

## Configuration

You can configure the database connection details in the `config.yaml` file located in the `config/` directory.

Example `config.yaml`:

```yaml
database: your_database_name
user: your_username
password: your_password
host: localhost
port: 5432
```

## Files

- `main.py`: Main script to process GTFS data and insert into the database.
- `config/config.yaml`: Configuration file for the database connection.
- `public/`: Directory to place GTFS data CSV files.
